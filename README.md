Umineko Project GOAT Edition
=================

This is a modified script of the [Umineko Project](https://umineko-project.org) PS3 to PC port, bringing various optional changes to the base release such as the original openings for EP1-4, larger text and new logos.

So far this is **only for playing the game in English** with Umineko Project's translation, so do not install the patch using this script if you intend to play in any other language.

## Notable changes to vanilla Umineko Project
- Original Akiko Shikata opening movies for EP1-4
- Spoiler-filled Rondo and Nocturne openings only viewable after finishing EP4 and EP8 respectively
- New logos for menus, chapter breaks and text boxes
- Increased text size, updated margins and positioning
- EP1 Tea Party post-credits scene moved back to before the credits as in the original PC games
- _no Naku Koro ni_ changed to _When They Cry_, matching the official English title convention with the logos

## Installation instructions
See instructions for the latest patch version at [releases](https://github.com/Pteryon/umipro-goat/releases).

## Credits
- Umineko Project - Most of the things

## Known Issues
- Credits scenes use the old logos/titles, simply because the images haven't been edited yet
- Changed files have not been added to file verification at the start of the game
- Patch relies on ons.cfg settings to increase Japanese text size and skip file verification
- No openings displayed at launch
- Legacy op1.ogg is the same file as op.ogg, just required separately for the current script of the music box to work
- Smaller text than preferable in some scenes to avoid awkward line breaks
